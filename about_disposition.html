						<h2>Personality</h2>
						<br>The happy, energetic Pembroke Welsh Corgi always has a smile on his face. He has been described as a cross between a cruise-line social director and a high-school hall monitor, and that is an apt characterization. The Pembroke always wants to be involved in whatever his family is doing, and he’d especially like to be in charge.

						<br><br>This is a dog with a strong work ethic. He needs a job to keep his very intelligent brain occupied and out of trouble, as well as to burn off his abundant energy. He likes very long walks and is an enthusiastic competitor in dog sports such as agility, rally, tracking, flyball and, of course, herding. Teach him tricks, take him hiking, get him qualified as a therapy dog — he can do it all. It's always a good idea to check with your vet before starting any exercise program with your dog.

						<br><br>Sometimes the Corgi might seem to be a little too bright. He gets bored doing the same old thing over and over and is known for putting his a creative spin on obedience exercises and other activities.

						<br><br>Don’t get the idea that the Corgi is perfect. Perfectly funny, maybe, but that’s about all. He likes to have his own way, and he can be pushy when he wants something. Set firm rules and stick to them or you will soon find that your Pembroke is running your life. Once you let him get away with something, it’s very difficult to persuade him not to do it again.</p>

						<h2>Temperament</h2>
						<br>The Corgi is smart, but he needs training and consistency to become the dog of your dreams. Any dog, no matter how nice, can develop obnoxious levels of barking, digging and other undesirable behaviors if he is bored, untrained or unsupervised. And any dog can be a trial to live with during adolescence. In the case of the Pembroke, the “teen” years can start at six months and continue until the dog is about two years old.

						<br><br>Start training your Pembroke puppy the day you bring him home. Even at seven or eight weeks old, he is capable of soaking up everything you can teach him. Never wait until he is six months old to begin training, or you will have a bigger, more headstrong dog to deal with. If possible, get him into puppy kindergarten class by the time he is 10 to 12 weeks old, and socialize, socialize, socialize. 

						<br><br>Be aware that many puppy training classes require certain vaccines (like kennel cough) to be up to date, and many veterinarians recommend limited exposure to other dogs and public places until puppy vaccines (including rabies, distemper and parvovirus) have been completed. In lieu of formal training, you can begin training your puppy at home and socializing him among family and friends until puppy vaccines are completed.
